# "Multi language code generation for computational workflows" book

This repository has chapters, code, and organizational materials for the (very technical) book
"Multi language code generation for computational workflows".

***The book is not finished yet -- it is a work in progress...***

## Mission statement

To describe how from natural and programing languages specifications to make parsers and interpreters
for the generation of actionable or executable code.

## Programming languages

- Parsers and interpreters: [Raku](https://raku.org), [Wolfram Language (WL)](https://www.wolfram.com/language/).

- Computationa workflows: Julia, Python, R, WL.

## Exposition plan

More or less standard exposition plan is followed:

- Motivation 
 
  - (Why we care? What we try to accomplish?)
 
- Brief overview 

  - Approach taken
  
  - Functionalities or challenges to address
  
  - Limitations
  
- How the parsers are made?

- How the interpreter are made?

- Special effort and use cases

- Future work and how to redo the whole thing

## Who is the intended reader?

Developers interested in:

- Computational workflows

- Parsers an interpreters

## Code and related repositories

Two major types of code and related repositories: for parsing and interpretation, for computation.
